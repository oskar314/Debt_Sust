abstract : We evaluate the debt sustainability of a panel of OECD countries from 1995 - 2019 (some countries have shorter data) using a Bayesian Unit Root Test proposed by Sims under the Present Value condition of the Government Budget Constraint. We find striking different results compared with traditional Unit Root Tests like ADF.
